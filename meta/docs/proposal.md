What are the ties that bind metadata with the object it describes? This snapshot considers how embedded metadata standards like JSON-LD, RDFa, or Web Manifest files can cast and frame metadata within a Hip Hop MC/voiceover/narrator metaphor wherein new possibilities for discovery, archiving, and publication formats emerge.

##Full Proposal
Library and technology standards bodies have made choices about where metadata should reside. In many cases, a surrogate record - MARC, DublinCore, or a MODS .xml file - is used as description for an object. Other standards have evolved that embed metadata within the file itself (E.g., Adobe's XMP for .pdfs or EXIF for media). HTML and the Web are still looking for an answer to the metadata question. As a possible path forward, I take inspiration in the role of the narrator in A Tribe Called Quest’s tour guide character from their 1993 album, Midnight Marauders. The album is designed as a listening program with an informative, robotic voice leading you through your session with key points and facts about the album and group. I'll look at how embedded metadata containers like JSON-LD, RDFa, and Web Manifest files mirror Tribe’s "listening program as metadata" model. I'll discuss how these forms for metadata might lead to improved indexing, better archival metadata, and new expressions of scholarly literature namely the linked data nanopublication (<http://nanopub.org/guidelines/working_draft/>). Our test case will be a digital collection of annotated scholarly articles, The Range Science Information System ([arc.lib.montana.edu/range-science/](https://arc.lib.montana.edu/range-science/)) to which I'll apply these embeddable metadata techniques to show improved browsing/discovery, new possibilities for archival description, and new publishing expressions. And overall, we'll consider new ways of thinking about cataloging the Web and whether metadata works better the closer it is connected to the object it is describing.
