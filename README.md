# metadata-nanopub

**What are the ties that bind metadata with the object it describes?** 

This repo looks at how embedded metadata standards like JSON-LD, RDFa, or Web Manifest files can cast and frame metadata within a Hip Hop MC/voiceover/narrator metaphor wherein new possibilities for discovery, archiving, and publication formats emerge.

The talk that tries to articulate these ideas is available at [https://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/talks/dlf2016-metadata-nanopub.pdf](https://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/talks/dlf2016-metadata-nanopub.pdf).
